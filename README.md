# Understanding-and-enhancement-of-internal-clustering-validation-measures


11 existing internal clustering validation measures are investigated in different aspects. The experiment results show that
these measures are only applicable in certain situations. In particular, none of them performs well on data sets with arbitrary 
shapes. A new internal clustering validation measure, named CVNN is proposed, which exploits the notion of nearest neighbors and 
uses dynamic multiple objects as representatives for different clusters in different situations. Experimental results show that 
CVNN is capable to suggest the correct number of clusters as well as the best partition on various synthetic and real-world data 
sets, including the data set with arbitrary cluster shapes.
